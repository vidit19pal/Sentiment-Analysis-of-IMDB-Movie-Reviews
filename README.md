# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves analyzing and determining the sentiment or subjective information expressed in a piece of text. It aims to understand the underlying sentiment, emotion, or opinion of the writer or speaker.The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify text into predefined sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. It helps in extracting subjective information from text data and provides insights into the overall sentiment or attitude of individuals or groups towards a particular topic, product, service, or event.

The IMDB dataset used in this project is having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing positive (1) and negative (2). A dataset of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing is provided. Thus the task is to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
Algorithms used are TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Adaboost with highest accuracy score of 88.92% achieved by Support Vector Classifier.
